  <h1 class="w3-xlarge">We believe that all health comes from the gut.<br>
   That goes both mentally and physically. When your gut health is poor, your immune system is also affected. <br>
Poor gut health also affects your skin, making it rough and scaly. A healthy gut provides more energy, a solid wall to protect you from sickness, better skin, and plenty more benefits. <br>
The following are our recommended foods to help you build, and maintain great gut health.

  <h2>Brown rice</h2>
  <p>
Not only is brown rice packed with fiber, it also is a great energy source! Because brown rice takes longer to digest, you will not feel as hungry. It also charges you with energy, far more than any other carbohydrate.
