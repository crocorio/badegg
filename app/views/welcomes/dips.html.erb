People with a heavy bench press are all over the place. Yes, it’s impressive, but common. <br>
Standing out from the crowd in a common field is hard. Competition is fierce, and body weight starts <br>
to play a big factor. The bigger the stronger is the template for strength. <br>
Weighted dips however, is a unique and minor territory that not many take part in. <br>
How many times have you seen someone dipping with over half their body weight hanging <br>
from their waist? Not often, I’d say. <br>
Bask in Glory as everyone admires your vicious triceps!
